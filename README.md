# üî§ Predictive Keyboard Model using PyTorch

This project implements a **predictive text keyboard model** using **PyTorch**, inspired by smart keyboards that suggest the next word based on previously typed text. It is a character-level or word-level language model trained on sample corpora to predict likely next words ‚Äî just like what you see in mobile keyboard apps.

## üìå Features

- üß† Neural network model built with **PyTorch**
- üìñ Trained on natural language corpus for predictive text suggestions
- üîÑ Support for training, validation, and testing cycles
- ‚úçÔ∏è Real-time next-word prediction based on user input
- üíæ Model saving/loading functionality

## üöÄ Project Highlights

- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and tokenized input text data using standard NLP preprocessing techniques.
- **Model Architecture**: Used an LSTM-based model for sequential prediction, built using PyTorch modules.
- **Training**: Supports batch training with adjustable learning rate and epochs.
- **Inference**: Accepts a string as input and generates predicted word(s) that may follow.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **NumPy / Pandas**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualizations)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## üìà Future Improvements
Integrate a word-level tokenizer for better semantic prediction
Use transformer-based architecture (e.g., GPT or BERT)
Deploy as a web-based predictive keyboard app
